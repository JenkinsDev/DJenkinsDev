            <h5>Come One, Come All</h5>
<p>I'd like to welcome you, the reader, to my blog.  This
is going to be the breeding ground for content ranging from
entry-level programming concepts to more complex topics.  Obviously, this blog won't
just be about programming though, its going to be the home to a lot of my thoughts in general.</p>
<h5>A Bit About Me</h5>
<p>My name is David Jenkins and I currently work over at <a href="https://boldmediagroup.com">Bold Media Group</a>.
I create some pretty awesome things there that revolve around
automation.  AUTOMATE EVERYTHING.  That's right, I am
a <em>HUGE</em> automation advocate, if it's a task that could be automated in some
form, then it should automated.  Isn't that what a lot of technology is for anyway?</p>
<p>Enough about that automation jazz!  You came here to read
about me anyway, didn't ya?  When I'm not working on...Work. I
am generally either spending time with the family, gaming at night or
trying to excel myself in some fashion - currently re-learning guitar and 
getting deep into my foray into learning new spoken languages.</p>
<p>I am attempting to make this site a sizeable chunk of my life, I want to spread
the wealth of knowledge as many have done before me.</p>
<h5>How It Was Built</h5>
<h6>The Back-End</h6>
<p>First thing's first, the site is rather basic and the portions that you see
are all static.  There's a catch though, no I don't write the articles in HTML, I
write them in <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>.  The static
side of the site, everything you see and that is on the server, is all generated
by a library called <a href="http://blog.getpelican.com/">Pelican</a>.  Ever heard of Jekyll?
It's the same concept, except Pelican is built on-top of Python which is my current language
of choice for most projects.</p>
<p>That's actually about it for the back-end, less a plugin I made while
writing up this article. It's called <a href="https://github.com/JenkinsDev/pelican-readtime">pelican-readtime</a>,
basically it does what the name suggests and determines what
the average read time would be for written content and stores that value in
an attribute called <code>readtime</code> within the content object.  The arithmetic used to
calculate the read time is based off of Medium's read time "algorithm."</p>
<h6>The Front-End</h6>
<p>TODO: Rewrite ( Haha! :) )</p>
<h5>Conclusion</h5>
<p>Well guys I think that's all I am going to cover in this here "Hello, World"
introduction.  I am hoping to make this a useful resource for everyone.
If you have any questions then just leave it down below in the comments section.
I'll make sure to check the comments frequently!</p>
<p>Auf Wiedersehen!</p>
