Summary: This isn't your normal Hello World introduction, this is my personal
         introduction to you, my readers.  Find out who I am, what I do
         and what this _blog_ is going to be all about.  Don't be afraid to ask
         questions for I will most likely answer.


##### Come One, Come All

Welcome to my blog where I shall mind control and make you all work in my
developer sweat shop! Nah, I am just messing with you, though that would be
really nice, it would make my life easier!

On a more serious note, I'd like to welcome you, the reader, to my blog.  This
is going to be the breading ground for some pretty gnarly content ranging from
simplistic programming concepts to more complex concepts like aspects of
game development.  Obviously this blog won't just be about programming though,
its going to be the home to a lot of my thoughts in general.


##### A Bit About Me
